Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation 

Summary 

Executive orders and proclamations are used extensively by Presidents to achieve policy goals, 
set uniform standards for managing the executive branch, or outline a policy view intended to 
influence the behavior of private citizens. The Constitution does not define these presidential 
instruments and does not explicitly vest the President with the authority to issue them. 
Nonetheless, such orders are accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power, and, if based 
on appropriate authority, they have the force and effect of law. This report discusses the nature of 
executive orders and proclamations, with a focus on the scope of presidential authority to execute 
such instruments and judicial and congressional responses thereto. 

In the 111 th Congress, several bills have been introduced regarding the revocation and 
modification of executive orders: H.R. 35, H.R. 500/S. 237, H.R. 603, H.R. 1228, H.R. 3465, 
H.R. 4453, and S. 2929. Other bills on executive orders proposed in this Congress are prescriptive 
and contain provisions that do not necessarily revoke or require alteration of executive orders: 
H.R. 21, H.R. 292, H.R. 669, H.R. 1082, H.R. 1367, H.R. 3293, S. 237, and S. 2929. In some 
cases, these bills may expand upon existing executive orders. 

The 111 th Congress has also passed several laws with provisions related to existing executive 
orders: P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA); P.L. 111-8, 
the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009; P.L. 111-80, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food 
and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010; and P.L. 111-117, the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Additionally, President Obama has issued an executive 
order titled Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's Consistency with Longstanding 
Restrictions on the Use of Federal Funds for Abortion, which was discussed during the House 
floor debate on H.R. 3590/P.L. 111-148.

Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation 

Definition and Authority 

The Constitution does not contain any provisions that define executive orders or proclamations. 
The most widely accepted description appears to be that of the House Government Operations 
Committee in 1957: 

Executive orders and proclamations are directives or actions by the President. When they are 
founded on the authority of the President derived from the Constitution or statute, they may 
have the force and effect of law.... In the narrower sense Executive orders and proclamations 
are written documents denominated as such.... Executive orders are generally directed to, and 
govern actions by, Government officials and agencies. They usually affect private 
individuals only indirectly. Proclamations in most instances affect primarily the activities of 
private individuals. Since the President has no power or authority over individual citizens 
and their rights except where he is granted such power and authority by a provision in the 
Constitution or by statute, the President's proclamations are not legally binding and are at 
best hortatory unless based on such grants of authority. The difference between Executive 
orders and proclamations is more one of form than of substance. 1 

In addition to executive orders and proclamations, Presidents often issue ‚Äúpresidential 
memoranda.‚Äù The distinction of these instruments from executive orders and proclamations is 
likewise more a matter of form than of substance. Specifically, all three instruments can be 
employed to direct and govern the actions of government officials and agencies. 2 Further, if 
issued under a valid claim of authority and published, all three may have the force and effect of 
law, requiring courts to take judicial notice of their existence. 3 Indeed, it would appear that the 
only technical difference between executive orders and proclamations in relation to presidential 
memoranda is that the former must be published in the Federal Register, while the latter are 
published only when the President determines that they have ‚Äúgeneral applicability and legal 
effect.‚Äù 4 

Just as there is no definition of executive orders and proclamations in the Constitution, there is, 
likewise, no specific provision authorizing their issuance. As such, authority for the execution and 
implementation of executive orders stems from implied constitutional and statutory authority. In 
the constitutional context, presidential power to issue such orders has been derived from Article 
II, which states that ‚Äúthe executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States,‚Äù that 
‚Äúthe President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States,‚Äù and that

the President ‚Äúshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.‚Äù 5 The President's power to 
issue executive orders and proclamations may also derive from express or implied statutory 
authority. 6 Irrespective of the implied nature of the authority to issue executive orders and 
proclamations, these instruments have been employed by every President since the inception of 
the Republic. 7 
Despite the amorphous nature of the authority to issue executive orders, Presidents have not 
hesitated to wield this power over a wide range of often controversial subjects, such as the 
suspension of the writ of habeas corpus; 8 the establishment of internment camps during World 
War II; 9 and equality of treatment in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or 
national origin. 10 President Obama recently issued an executive order pertaining to the abortion 
provisions in the new health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 11 This 
broad usage of executive orders to effectuate policy goals has led some commentators to suggest 
that many such orders constitute executive lawmaking that impacts the interests of private 
citizens and encroaches upon congressional power. 12 The controversial nature of many 
presidential directives thus raises questions regarding whether and how executive orders may be 
amended or revoked.

Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation 
Judicially Enforced Limitations 
The proper flamework for analyzing executive orders in the judicial context may be found in 
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. 13 There, the Supreme Court dealt with President 
Truman's executive order directing the seizure of steel mills, which was issued in an effort to 
avert the effects of a workers' strike during the Korean War. Invalidating this action, the majority 
held that under the Constitution, ‚Äúthe President's power to see that laws are faithfully executed 
refines the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.‚Äù 14 Specifically, Justice Black maintained that 
presidential authority to issue such an executive order ‚Äúmust stem either from an act of Congress 
or from the Constitution itself.‚Äù 15 Applying this reasoning, Justice Black's opinion for the Court 
determined that as no statute or Constitutional provision authorized such presidential action, the 
seizure order was in essence a legislative act. The Court further noted that Congress had rejected 
seizure as a means to settle labor disputes during consideration of the Taft-Hartley Act. Given this 
characterization, the Court deemed the executive order to be an unconstitutional violation of the 
separation of powers doctrine, explaining ‚Äúthe founders of this Nation entrusted the lawmaking 
power to the Congress alone in both good and bad times.‚Äù 16 
While Justice Black's majority opinion in Youngstown seems to refine the notion that the 
President possesses implied constitutional powers, it is important to note that there were five 
concurrences in the case, four of which maintained that implied presidential authority adheres in 
certain contexts. 17 Of these concurrences, Justice Jackson's has proven to be the most influential, 
even surpassing the impact of Justice Black's majority opinion. 
Justice Jackson's Concurrence 
Jackson established a tri-partite scheme for analyzing the validity of presidential actions in 
relation to constitutional and congressional authority. 18 Jackson's first category focuses on 
whether the President has acted according to an express or implied grant of congressional 
authority. If so, according to Jackson, presidential ‚Äúauthority is at its maximum, for it includes all 
that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate,‚Äù and such action is 
‚Äúsupported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation.‚Äù 19 
Secondly, Justice Jackson maintained that, in situations where Congress has neither granted or 
denied authority to the President, the President acts in reliance only ‚Äúupon his own independent 
powers, but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, 
or in which its distribution is uncertain.‚Äù 20 In the third and final category, Justice Jackson stated 
that in instances where presidential action is ‚Äúincompatible with the express or implied will of 
Congress,‚Äù the power of the President is at its minimum, and any such action may be supported

pursuant only to the President's ‚Äúown constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of 
Congress over the matter.‚Äù 21 In such a circumstance, presidential action must rest upon an 
exclusive power, and the Courts can uphold the measure ‚Äúonly by disabling the Congress from 
acting upon the subject.‚Äù 22 
Applying this scheme to the case at hand, Justice Jackson determined that analysis under the first 
category was inappropriate, due to the fact that President Truman's seizure of the steel mills had 
not been authorized by Congress, either implicitly or explicitly. Justice Jackson also determined 
that the second category was ‚Äúclearly eliminated,‚Äù in that Congress had addressed the issue of 
seizure, through statutory policies conflicting with the President's actions. 23 Employing the third 
category, Justice Jackson noted that President Truman's actions could only be sustained by 
determining that the seizure was ‚Äúwithin his domain and beyond control by Congress. ‚Äú24 Justice 
Jackson established that such matters were not outside the scope of congressional power, 
reinforcing his declaration that permitting the President to exercise such ‚Äúconclusive and 
preclusive‚Äù power would endanger ‚Äúthe equilibrium established by our constitutional system.‚Äù 25 
These standards remain applicable in the modern era. In 1996, the United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia invalidated an executive order issued by President Clinton on the 
grounds that it conflicted with the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). 26 The order at issue 
prohibited federal agencies from contracting with employers that permanently replaced striking 
employees. Upon determining that the order conflicted with a provision of the NLRA 
guaranteeing the right to hire permanent replacements during strikes, the court of appeals held 
that the statute preempted the executive order, stripping it of any effect. 2v 
Congressional Revocation and Alteration of 
Executive Orders 
Further, as long as it is not constitutionally based, Congress may repeal a presidential order, or 
terminate the underlying authority upon which the action is predicated. For example, in 2006, 
Congress revoked part of an executive order from November 12, 1838, which reserved certain 
public land for lighthouse purposes. 28 Congress has also explicitly revoked executive orders in 
their entirety, such as in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which revoked a December 13, 1912, 
executive order that created Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 2. 29 Another example of the 
express nullification of an executive order by Congress involved the revocation of an executive

order by President George H. W. Bush to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to establish a human fetal tissue bank for research purposes. 30 To effectuate this repeal, 
Congress simply directed that the ‚Äúthe provisions of Executive Order 12806 shall not have any 
legal effect.‚Äù 31 There have been numerous similarly revoked executive orders and proposals to 
revoke particular executive orders. 32 
Additionally, Congress has used its appropriations authority to limit the effect of executive orders, 
such as denying salaries and expenses for an office established in an executive order, 33 as well as 
denying funds to implement a particular section of a subsequently revoked executive order that 
would have enabled agency heads to designate a presidential appointee to serve as the agency's 
regulatory policy officer. 34 Additionally, Congress has used appropriations acts to enable a 
program created by executive order to receive donations for publicity materials about the 
program. 35 Outside of appropriations bills, other legislative proposals have included those that 
would codify existing executive orders with modifications. 36 
Select Laws Concerning Executive Orders Enacted During the 
111 th Congress 
The 111 th Congress has passed several laws with provisions relating to existing executive orders. 
For instance, P.L. 111-5, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) 
transferred functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and administrative actions that applied to the 
National Coordinator for Health Information Technology appointed under an executive order or 
the related office to the National Coordinator appointed under that law and the applicable office. 
Furthermore, appropriations acts, such as P.L. 111-8 and P.L. 111-117, contain several provisions 
on funding of various executive orders, including the provisions mentioned in the previous 
paragraph denying funding for sections of executive orders and enabling the receipt of donations 
related to executive orders. P.L. 111-8 also contains prohibitions on the use of funds to delay 
implementation of executive orders. Another appropriations act, P.L. 111-80, denies funding for 
the promulgation of proposed or final rules allowing importation of Chinese poultry products, if 
the rules were not issued according to the procedures for significant rules set forth in an executive 
order.

31 P.L. 103-43, 107 Stat. 133, ¬ß 121. Given the highly speculative basis of any asserted constitutional authority for the

Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation 
Legislative Proposals in the 111 th Congress 
In the 111 th Congress, several bills have been introduced regarding the revocation and 
modification of executive orders. For example, H.R. 35, H.R. 500/S. 237, and H.R. 1228 would 
deem particular executive orders to be without force or effect; H.R. 603 would revoke part of an 
executive order on certain lands identified for conveyance; H.R. 3465 would supersede an 
executive order; and H.R. 4453 would require the President to revoke an executive order and 
amend a separate, older executive order to restore the words removed by the executive order to be 
revoked. S. 2929 would require notice of presidential revocations, modifications, waivers, or 
suspensions of executive orders, or authorization of such an action, to be published in the Federal 
Register within 30 days after such action is taken. 
Other bills on executive orders proposed in the 111 th Congress are prescriptive, and do not 
necessarily require presidential modification or revocation of executive orders. For example, H.R. 
21 would establish a committee in the Executive Office of the President that would succeed a 
committee established by executive order. H.R. 292 would require the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs to ensure that that department is complying with a particular executive order. H.R. 669 
would redesignate an office established by an executive order. H.R. 1082 would prohibit 
importation of foreign-made American flags, regardless of whether their proportions complied 
with an executive order. H.R. 1367 would expand the applicability of several executive orders to 
parent companies of foreign entities that commit acts outside the United States that would violate 
such executive orders if the acts were committed in the United States. H.R. 3293 would prohibit 
the appropriation or availability of funds for the procurement of goods made by child labor in 
certain industries and countries, in accordance with an executive order. S. 237 would provide for 
the continued existence of a council despite termination of an applicable section of an executive 
order. 
Presidential Revocation and Alteration of 
Executive Orders 
Illustrating the fact that executive orders are used to further an administration's policy goals, there 
are frequent examples of situations in which a sitting President has revoked or amended orders 
issued by his predecessor. 37 This practice is particularly apparent where Presidents have used 
these instruments to assert control over and influence the agency rulemaking process. President 
Ford, for instance, issued Executive Order 11821, requiring agencies to issue inflation impact 
statements for proposed regulations. 38 President Carter altered this practice with Executive Order 
37 For example, on February 17, 2001, in Executive Orders 13201-04, President Bush revoked a series of executive 
orders issued by President Clinton regarding union dues and labor contracts, significantly altering several requirements 
pertaining to government contracts. 66 Fed. Reg. 11221, 11225, 11227-28 (2001); see Exec. Order No. 12871, 58 Fed. 
Reg. 52201 (1993); Exec. Order 12933, 59 Fed. Reg. 53559 (1994). President Obama revoked Executive Order 13201 
in Executive Order 13496. 74 Fed. Reg. 6107 (Feb. 4, 2009). He revoked Executive Order 13202 in Executive Order 
13502. 74 Fed. Reg. 6985 (Feb. 11, 2009). President Obama also revoked Executive Order 13204 in Executive Order 
13495. 74 Fed. Reg. 6103 (Feb. 4, 2009).

Executive Orders: Issuance and Revocation 
12044, requiring agencies to consider the potential economic impact of certain rules and identify 
potential alternatives. 39 
Shortly after taking office, President Reagan revoked President Carter's order, implementing a 
scheme asserting much more extensive control over the rulemaking process. Executive Order 
12291 directed agencies to implement rules only if ‚Äúthe potential benefits to society for the 
regulation outweigh the potential costs to society,‚Äù requiring agencies to prepare a cost-benefit 
analysis for any proposed rule that could have a significant economic impact. 4¯ This order was 
criticized by some as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, on the grounds that it 
imbued the President with the power to essentially control rulemaking authority that had been 
committed to a particular agency by Congress. 41 Despite these concerns, there were no court 
rulings assessing the validity of President Reagan's order. In turn, President Clinton issued 
Executive Order 12866, modifying the system established during the Reagan Administration. 42 
While retaining many of the basic features of President Reagan's order, E.O. 12866 eased cost- 
benefit analysis requirements, and recognized the primary duty of agencies to fulfill the duties 
committed to them by Congress. President George W. Bush issued two executive orders 
amending E.O. 12866, E.O. 13258, and E.O. 13422, both of which were revoked by President 
Obama in E.O. 13497. 43 President Bush's E.O. 13258 concerned regulatory planning and review, 
and it removed references in E.O. 12866 to the role of the Vice President, replacing several of 
them with a reference to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or the 
Chief of Staff to the President. 44 E.O. 13422 defined guidance documents and significant 
guidance documents and applied several parts of E.O. 12866 to guidance documents, as well as 
required each agency head to designate a presidential appointee to the newly created position of 
regulatory policy officeril s E.O. 13422 also made changes to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs' (OIRA's) duties and authorities, including a requirement that OIRA be given 
advance notice of significant guidance documents. 46 President Obama's executive order revoking 
E.O. 13258 and E.O. 13422 also directed the Director of OMB and the heads of executive 
departments and agencies to rescind orders, rules, guidelines, and policies that implemented those 
executive orders. 47
